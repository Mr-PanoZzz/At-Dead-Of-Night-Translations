Ghosts can manifest in either high or low energy states, but for voice communication a low energy state is required.<br><br>Ghosts may be prompted to shift between energy states by provocative or aggressive questioning. If a Ghost enters a high energy state, this device will receive only a loud static noise and communication cannot proceed any further.<br><br>Ghosts in a high energy state often manifest physically, without electronic or optical aid. This usually occurs at a different location. Please bear in mind that supernatural entities are the souls of the Dead. Please treat them with due respect.",

"<div class='ht'><span style='font-size:170%'>Game Play Advice</span><br><br>Play At Dead Of Night at dead of night, or at least in a dark room, and make sure there are as few background sounds as possible, or use headphones if you're playing alone.<br><br>You'll need to be able to see into the darkest areas of the image since much of the hotel is dark and Jimmy's shadow can sometimes only just be seen. Use the brightness (U/I keys) to bring up the shadows if you need to.<br><br>Jimmy's voice can be heard if he's on the same floor. If you listen carefully you can also hear his footsteps, which help tell you how close he is. Ghosts also make sounds. If you want to listen more carefully, press 'D' to dip the background ambience for a moment.<br><br>If you need hearing assistance select the 'Enhanced Description' option under 'Subtitles.' If you don't need this assistance it's advisable to leave this switched off.<br><br>Compasses point towards ghosts even through walls, so if you can't find a ghost in the direction it's pointing, try walking around the corridors. Compasses spin slowly when there's no ghosts around and spin more quickly when you're right near one.<br><br>Remember you can look through keyholes to see into rooms and you can run faster down long corridors by moving the arrow to the top of the screen.</div>",

But Harvey was worried about Jimmy's mind, the things he was imagining.","H","It was Doctor Bose. He was supposed to help Jimmy, but Jimmy was beyond help.","R","Doctor Bose. He came to help Jimmy."],

What he was doing with it is another story.","R","Harvey said Jimmy had probably killed it himself, but I didn't believe him."],

He did it to himself, it wasn't Jimmy."],

  ["P","I was worried Rose would believe Jimmy. It was a bare faced lie. But I managed to convince Rose Jimmy was making it up.","H","He was worried about what else Jimmy would make up about him. And he was right to be.","R","Because he was worried about his reputation. I didn't know who to believe. but I decided to give him another chance."],
  ["P","I thought when he realised he'd been caught lying he'd start to engage with me and do what I asked. Instead he just made up another lie. Only this one was much worse. The worst.","R","He was talking to Jimmy, trying to control him. Get him to do things, bad things. I should never have trusted him."],

  ["P","I'd had enough. There was no going back. My life was over anyway.","H","Because he'd been driven to it. Everyone thought he'd.... touched Jimmy. Jimmy was clever, you see, too clever. The doctor had no chance. Poor soul.","R","Because he knew he was guilty. He did the right thing."],
  ["P","It was Harvey. He knew Jimmy was lying about me. Harvey understood.","H","It was me. Jimmy had made accusations about the doctor. Rose believed him, but I'd heard that story somewhere before.","R","It was Harvey. He didn't believe what Jimmy was saying. But I knew he wasn't lying."],
  ["P","Jimmy never admitted his lies.","H","Course he didn't! He just laughed. Then he started setting little traps for me. Some of them not so little.","R","No - how could Jimmy admit to something that wasn't true? Harvey was wrong to bully Jimmy like that."],
  ["H","He knew that was my heater, he'd wired the casing straight to the mains. Almost killed me. He did it deliberately, but Rose wouldn't have it. I knew he needed to be taught a lesson. He'd damaged my property so I decided to damage his.","R","Harvey blamed Jimmy, but that heater was faulty. Harvey should have thrown it away."],
  ["P","I don't know, but violence only makes things worse.","H","I smashed up his television and games consoles and stuff. I was angry; but it didn't work. It just made him worse. He soon retaliated.","R","He ruined Jimmy's things. He couldn't control his anger."],
  ["H","Jimmy had set it up to fire when I opened the door. I had to go to into A&E, get stitches and tetanus shots. When I got back I couldn't find him. Rose said he was hiding in the basement. That gave me an idea.","R","Harvey said Jimmy had shot him with an arrow, but I knew Jimmy wouldnât use a weapon like that."],
  ["H","I wanted to give Jimmy a dose of his own medicine. I thought he couldnât do any damage down there. I was wrong.","R","I donât know what he was doing."],
  ["P","I donât remember it.","H","We managed to contain it before it got out of hand. But all our old photos and letters and everything were down there, it all went up in flames. Jimmy was out of control, Iâd had enough of him. I wanted him gone.","R","Harvey blamed Jimmy, but it was a loose wire that started that fire. It was an accident."],
  ["P","I donât know. But Harvey couldnât control his anger.","H","I donât know what I was going to do. Threaten him, get him out of the hotel.... Problem was, I didnât realise he was going to be armed too.","R","I donât know. Harvey shouldnât have had a gun in the hotel."],
  ["H","I was looking for Jimmy."],

  ["H","Jimmy crept up behind me, I didnât see him. Jimmy always won in the end.","R","Harvey had gone mad. Jimmy was just defending himself."],
  ["H","Rose - Rose believed Jimmy. She defended him, right to the end.","R","It was me. I had to explain to the police that the dagger was just a letter opener and that Harvey had a loaded gun. Jimmy acted in self-defence. They understood."],
  ["H","Jimmy - they let Jimmy go. They said it was self-defence, that Iâd tried to shoot Jimmy. But it was all lies.","R","Jimmy - he was coming home. The police understood. They believed him, but it changed him. He started helping me, helping run the hotel. And he found a way of bringing in more guests."],
  ["H","I donât know who he was.","R","I was enjoying it, we were making money again. Everything seemed to be getting better until.... Jimmy started behaving oddly. I heard him shouting, staring at himself. He seemed angry."],
  ["R","Jimmy - I didn't understand at first, I was confused. But then I realised. Jimmy wasnât the one doing these things. Like the mirrors, he was starting to fracture. Jimmy wasnât in control anymore."],
  ["H","I don't know, but I know Jimmy always ruined everything eventually.","R","It wasn't Jimmy on stage anymore, it was Hugo Punch, his comedy character. Hugo started insulting his audience every night. He seemed to be enjoying it. Then one night after the show a guest told Jimmy what she thought of him. Jimmy lost his temper. He did something stupid."],
  ["R","Journalists, they wanted Jimmy. But Jimmy wasn't in control, it was Hugo Punch who tied the woman up. Jimmy couldn't control it anymore. He was depressed. He just wanted to leave everything behind and go."],
  ["R","It was Jimmy. He tried to kill himself. That's why I had to tell him the truth."],
  ["H","I don't know. There were things Rose never told me.","R","Hugo - I buried him down there in concrete, in a secret room. I should have done it sooner. I let him abuse Jimmy for too long. It was my fault Jimmy turned out the way he did. I thought the guilt would go away if I told Jimmy. I was wrong, it made it worse. I couldnât accept what I'd done. I couldn't live with myself."],

  ["R","I thought having a child would solve everything. I was wrong."],
  ["R","I admitted it all to Jimmy. Jimmy didn't remember Hugo, he'd blocked out the memory. Hugo beat Jimmy from when he was born, for 2 years. I should have stopped it earlier."],
  ["R","I had no choice. Jimmy had gone to find Hugo's grave. I was alone. I knew what I should do."],

  ["A","I jumped, but then it all went dark and I couldn't wake up. I can't wake up anymore.","P","[The girl] fell down the stairs from the top floor. She was too drunk to know what she was doing. It was the reason Rose got in touch with me.","H","[The girl] fell from the top floor down the stairs. I knew Jimmy had to be behind it.","R","[The girl] fell. Harvey blamed Jimmy for it. It was the girl's own fault, not Jimmy's."],
  ["P","I got a call from Rose. She wanted me to find out what was bothering Jimmy. But Harvey was worried about the things Jimmy was imagining.","H","Doctor Bose was supposed to help Jimmy, but Jimmy was beyond help.","R","Doctor Bose came to help Jimmy."],
  ["P","Jimmy was killing things. I realised he needed to work on his empathy skills. So I asked him to think of something nice he could do for me. He came up with an idea right away.","H","Jimmy said he'd found [the dead rabbit] somewhere. What he was doing with it is another story.","R","Harvey said Jimmy had probably killed [the rabbit] himself, but I didn't believe him."],
  ["P","Jimmy was making me a sandwich. He brought it up to my room, as I asked. I didn't suspect anything was wrong at first.","H","The doctor was trying to educate Jimmy, get him to help out. Big mistake.","R","Doctor Bose kept trying to make Jimmy do things he didn't want to."],
  ["P","Jimmy had put broken glass in my sandwich. I nearly choked on it. I realised I'd underestimated Jimmy's illness. I had to step up his treatment, urgently.","H","[Doctor Bose] learned about Jimmy the hard way. Jimmy's pranks always went too far.","R","[Doctor Bose] cut himself, but then he tried to blame Jimmy. He did it to himself, it wasn't Jimmy."],
  ["P","Jimmy refused to let me administer the drug. Then he told Rose I'd tried to force him to take it, that I'd used violence. It was ridiculous!","H","I don't know, I wasn't there.","R","[Doctor Bose] was trying to medicate Jimmy, without my permission."],
  ["P","I was worried Rose would believe Jimmy. It was a bare faced lie. But I managed to convince Rose that Jimmy was making it up.","H","[Doctor Bose] was worried about what else Jimmy would make up about him. And he was right to be.","R","Because [Doctor Bose] was worried about his reputation. But I decided to give him another chance."],
  ["P","I thought when [Jimmy] realised he'd been caught lying he'd start to engage with me. Instead he just made up another lie. Only this one was much worse. The worst.","R","[Doctor Bose] was talking to Jimmy, trying to control him. Get him to do bad things. I should never have trusted him."],
  ["P","Rose reported me. I knew they'd strike me off. I had no career, no future. I decided to take control, once and for all.","H","They were going to arrest [Doctor Bose]. Jimmy had ruined him. But I didn't believe any of it.","R","They came to arrest [Doctor Bose]. He deserved everything he got."],
  ["P","I'd had enough. There was no going back. My life was over anyway.","H","[Doctor Bose had] been driven to it. Everyone thought he'd 'touched' Jimmy. Jimmy was too clever. The doctor had no chance.","R","[Doctor Bose] knew he was guilty. He did the right thing."],
  ["P","Harvey knew Jimmy was lying about me. Harvey understood.","H","Jimmy had made accusations about the doctor. Rose believed him, but I'd heard that story somewhere before.","R","Harvey didn't believe what Jimmy was saying [about the doctor], but I knew he wasn't lying."],
  ["P","Jimmy never admitted his lies.","H","Jimmy just laughed. Then he started setting little traps for me. Some of them not so little.","R","How could Jimmy admit to something that wasn't true? Harvey was wrong to bully Jimmy like that."],
  ["H","[Jimmy] knew that was my heater, he'd wired the casing straight to the mains. I knew he needed to be taught a lesson. He'd damaged my property so I decided to damage his.","R","Harvey blamed Jimmy, but that heater was faulty. Harvey should have thrown it away."],
  ["P","I don't know [what Harvey was doing with the bat], but violence only makes things worse.","H","I smashed up [Jimmy's] television and games consoles. I was angry. But it didn't work. It just made him worse. He soon retaliated.","R","[Harvey] ruined Jimmy's things. He couldn't control his anger."],
  ["H","Jimmy had set [the crossbow] up to fire when I opened the door. I had to go to into A&E. When I got back I couldn't find him. Rose said he was hiding in the basement. That gave me an idea.","R","Harvey said Jimmy had shot him with an arrow, but I knew Jimmy wouldnât use a weapon like that."],
  ["H","I wanted to give Jimmy a dose of his own medicine. I thought he couldnât do any damage [in the basement]. I was wrong.","R","I donât know what [Harvey] was doing [in the basement]."],
  ["P","I donât remember [the hotel fire].","H","We managed to contain [the hotel fire] before it got out of hand. But all our old photos and letters were down there, it all went up in flames. Jimmy was out of control, Iâd had enough of him. I wanted him gone.","R","Harvey blamed Jimmy [for the hotel fire], but it was a loose wire that started that fire. It was an accident."],
  ["P","I donât know [where the gun came from]. But Harvey couldnât control his anger.","H","I donât know what I was going to do [with the gun]. Problem was, I didnât realise he was going to be armed too.","R","I donât know [where the gun came from]. Harvey shouldnât have had a gun in the hotel."],
  ["H","I was looking for Jimmy."],
  ["H","Jimmy crept up behind me, I didnât see him. Jimmy always won in the end.","R","Harvey had gone mad. Jimmy was just defending himself."],
  ["H","Rose believed Jimmy. She defended him, right to the end.","R","I had to explain to the police that the dagger was just a letter opener and that Harvey had a loaded gun. Jimmy acted in self-defence. They understood."],
  ["H","[The police] let Jimmy go. They said it was self-defence, that Iâd tried to shoot Jimmy. But it was all lies.","R","Jimmy was coming home. The police understood [it was self-defence]. But it changed him, he started helping run the hotel. And he found a way of bringing in more guests."],
  ["H","I donât know who [Hugo Punch] was.","R","I was enjoying it, we were making money again. Then Jimmy started behaving oddly. I heard him shouting, staring at himself. He seemed angry."],
  ["R","I didn't understand at first, I was confused. But then I realised Jimmy wasnât the one doing these things. Like the mirrors, he was starting to fracture. Jimmy wasnât in control anymore."],
  ["H","I don't know, but I know Jimmy always ruined everything eventually.","R","It wasn't Jimmy on stage anymore, it was Hugo Punch. He started insulting his audience every night. Then one night after the show a guest told Jimmy what she thought of him. He lost his temper and did something stupid."],
  ["R","Journalists [were banging on the door], they wanted Jimmy. But it was Hugo Punch who tied the woman up. Jimmy couldn't control it anymore. He was depressed. He just wanted to leave everything behind and go."],
  ["R","It was Jimmy [in the bath]. He tried to kill himself. That's why I had to tell him the truth."],
  ["H","I don't know [who Rose was attacking]. There were things Rose never told me.","R","I buried Hugo [in the basement] in concrete, in a secret room. I let him abuse Jimmy for too long. It was my fault Jimmy turned out the way he did. I thought the guilt would go away if I told Jimmy. I was wrong, it made it worse. I couldnât accept what I'd done. I couldn't live with myself."],
  ["R","If I hadn't [killed] myself Jimmy would have, or rather, Hugo would have. Hugoâs still in charge, even now. He's controlling Jimmy. Ask Jimmy to show you where Hugo lives."],
  ["H","I never knew [The Great Hugo].","R","Hugo was a magician and an entertainer. He bought the hotel to promote his stage show. He became famous. I worked as his assistant, then things developed."],
  ["R","I never knew what he wanted. There was only one thing I could give him."],
  ["R","Hugo was a violent, evil, sick man."],
  ["A","Yes! [Jimmy] took it when I wasnât looking and stole my money. I told him off but he wouldnât listen."],
  ["A","[Jimmy] soaked my toy with that stuff in the bottle. I hated him!"],
  ["A","[Jimmy] got the sword down from the wall, it looked really sharp. He made me promise not to tell anyone and he said he could make my hand stop hurting."],
  ["A","[Jimmy] told me to keep drinking [the medicine]. It was horrible. Then I started to feel strange."],
  ["P","[The violent drawings] suggested a turbulent personality, but I wasn't particularly concerned until I started to realise how far [Jimmy's] imagination went."],
  ["P","Jimmy said he'd make something for me, so I followed him to see what he was going to do."],
  ["P","[Jimmy putting glass in a sandwich] was my first encounter with Jimmyâs sense of humour."],
  ["P","[Diazepam] wasnât the ideal medication, but it was all I had. Jimmy needed treating immediately. He was dangerous."],
  ["P","Jimmy said Iâd used the paddle to beat him. I would never use violence against a patient, it was ridiculous! But Rose believed him."],
  ["P","Jimmy accused me of the worst crime possible. He took it from a newspaper story he'd read. He was making it all up."],
  ["P","I experimented with the washing line, but it was too thin. I found some rope instead. I still had my keys to the hotel so I crept in one night while I was on bail."],
  ["H","As soon as I found that scrapbook I knew where Jimmy had got [the story] from. It was the same, down to every detail."],
  ["H","Jimmy was always playing with electricity. Funny how he was never the one who got shocked."],
  ["H","I kept those bats for self-defence, but I was angry. I took one and went to Jimmyâs room."],
  ["H","Jimmy was fond of weapons like [the crossbow]. I hadnât seen Jimmy all night after I'd smashed his stuff. I should have guessed heâd been working on his next little trick."],
  ["H","Well if Jimmy wanted to hide [in the basement] I thought he must like it."],
  ["H","Nobody realised how far Jimmy would go to get attention."],
  ["H","I'd lost it. I was seeing red, I hated him. I'd lost control."],
  ["H","[The letter opener] wasn't even a dagger! But I never learned my lesson, Jimmy was always one step ahead of me."],
  ["R","Jimmy started doing a comedy act on stage: Hugo Punch. He was good. People started to come just to watch him."],
  ["R","Breaking the mirrors was just the start. He didnât remember doing it. Then other strange things started happening."],
  ["R","Jimmy locked [the woman who made a complaint] in a room and tied her up. I found her and let her go. She didnât press charges, but she told the newspapers."],
  ["R","Jimmy had been fighting Hugo Punch all his life. Jimmy didnât want to live anymore."],
  ["R","[Hugo and I] were married. We were happy at first, before things started to change."],
  ["R","I thought having a child would solve everything. I was wrong."],
  ["R","I admitted it all to Jimmy. Hugo beat Jimmy from when he was born, for 2 years. I should have stopped it earlier."],
  ["R","Jimmy had gone to find Hugo's grave. I was alone. I knew what I should do."],
